4. To effectively work Meta Spark, you need to be able to move through 3D space. Which of the following are ways to zoom the camera in the Meta Spark Viewport? Select all that apply.

   - [x] **Mouse scroll wheel**
     > The mouse scroll wheel is a great, natural way to zoom in and out in the Meta Spark Viewport. You can also use a two-finger swipe gesture on a trackpad or left-click and drag while holding Control + Alt (Windows) or Command + Option (Mac).
   - [x] **Two-finger swipe gesture on trackpad**
     > A trackpad is a natural way to zoom the camera in and out in the Meta Spark Viewport. You can also use the mouse wheel or left-click and drag while holding Control + Alt (Windows) or Command + Option (Mac).
   - [ ] Command-Option-left click and drag on a Mac
   - [ ] Control-Alt-right click on a Windows PC

5. Attributes in the **Property Inspector** have small arrows next to them. What do these arrows do? Select the best answer.

   - [ ] Add a texture to an object
   - [x] **Map an input connection from the Patch Editor to control those attributes using logic**
   - [ ] Open a new World Object template
   - [ ] Place an AR object in the world
     > These arrows create a **Consumer Patch** that allows you to control an object’s attributes using the **Patch Editor**. For example, if you wanted to drive an object’s position, you’d click the arrow next to the **Position** attribute in the **Property Inspector**.
