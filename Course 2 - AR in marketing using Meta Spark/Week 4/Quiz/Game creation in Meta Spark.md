1. What do you use to implement logic within Spark using visual programming and nodes? Select the best answer.

    - [ ] Inspector
    - [x] **Patch Editor**
    - [ ] FaceTracker
    - [ ] Blender
        > The Patch Editor is how you implement logic within Spark using visual programming and nodes, and it is likely where you’ll be spending most of your time in Meta Spark.

2. Why can AR be a powerful marketing tool? Select the best answer.

    - [ ] The Meta Spark tools to create augmented reality experiences for social media are difficult to use, so it creates a specialized niche for creators.
    - [ ] AR creates a gap between the person and the experience.
    - [ ] AR pulls in data on what’s trending now through user interactions.
    - [x] **It can create meaningful experiences that bring a person back, organically.**
        > At its heart, marketing is about creating connection, energy and attention around a person, place or product. These are things that AR does very well.

3. What type of video should you record when you are ready to upload your effect to the Meta Spark Hub to showcase your effect’s features and capabilities? Select the best answer.

4. Based on its rotation and position, which light type affects the quality of the light it imparts on an object? Select the best answer.

    - [ ] Point light
    - [ ] Ambient light
    - [x] **Spot light**
    - [ ] Directional light
        > Both the rotation and position of a spot light affect the quality of the light it imparts on an object. This differs from a point light, which imparts light based only on where it’s positioned, and a directional light where rotation is all that matters.

5. What type of experience allows a developer to create a scene in which a virtual picture is hanging on a wall based on the position and interactions enabled on the effect? Select the best answer.

    - [ ] Virtual Reality
    - [ ] Augmented Reality
    - [ ] Segmentation
    - [ ] Occluders
        > Augmented reality (AR) is technology that allows us to overlay a virtual image on top of the physical world in real time. Since AR interacts with the physical world, it needs to track the physical world as it happens.

6. Consumer patches consume signals created by other patches in a graph and change properties as a result. Select the best answer.

    - [x] **True**
    - [ ] False
        > Consumer patches consume signals created by other patches in a graph and change properties as a result. They represent the property of the object in your scene that you want the graph to affect.

7. What are the best practices that you should use when choosing a target image for your AR effect? Select all that apply.

    - [ ] Use images on curved surfaces.
