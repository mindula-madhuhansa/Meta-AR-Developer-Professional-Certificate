3. What are the benefits of using coding conventions? Select all that apply.

   - [x] **Coding conventions create a consistent look to the code, so that readers can focus on content, not layout.**
     > Coding conventions play an important role in any AR projects because they demonstrate best practices by creating a consistent look to the code. This way, readers can focus on the content, not the layout.
   - [ ] Coding conventions provide boilerplate code so developers don’t have to create their own code.
   - [x] **Coding conventions enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous experience.**
     > Using coding conventions in AR projects is a best practice and helps enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous experience.
   - [x] **Coding conventions facilitate copying, changing and maintaining the code.**
     > Using coding conventions in AR projects is a best practice. Using these conventions, developers can more easily copy, change and maintain the code.

4. When naming a private or internal field, which naming convention should you use?

   - [x] **Camel case**
   - [ ] Pascal case
   - [ ] All caps
   - [ ] Snake case

6. True or false? The Unity Manual provides sample coding that you can copy and modify according to your needs. Select the best answer.

   - [x] **True**
   - [ ] False
     > The Unity Manual does provide the ability to copy code samples. This feature minimizes the need to start from scratch to recreate the wheel.

7. In which window can you attach a script to a GameObject?

   - [ ] Scene
   - [x] **Inspector**
   - [ ] Game
   - [ ] Hierarchy
     > The Inspector window is one location where you can attach a script to a GameObject.

8. When naming a component, what is the difference between the component name, the class and the filename of the script? Select the best answer.

   - [ ] They should all have distinctly different names.
   - [x] **There is no difference. These names should match.**
   - [ ] Only the filename and the class name should match.
   - [ ] The component name is the only element that needs to be named.
     > The names of components, class and filename of a script should match.

9. True or false? The setting of the enabled flag for a component is represented in the Inspector window by the checkbox next to the component name. Select the best answer.

   - [x] **True**
   - [ ] False
     > In a script, you can set the enabled flag of the component to true or false. This corresponds to the checkbox next to the name of the component in the Inspector.
