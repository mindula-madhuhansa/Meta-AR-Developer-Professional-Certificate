1. What is the best way to describe an array? Select the best answer.

   - [ ] A code that counts screen time for a game
   - [ ] A script that controls the scene
   - [ ] An arrow in the direction you want to move
   - [x] **A numbered list of objects**
     > An array is a numbered list of objects.

2. What does the Random.Range() method help create when writing your code?

   - [x] **Randomness**
     > The Random.Range() method can be used to generate random numbers within a set range.

3. Which of the following is an example of how to code using an array? Select the best answer.

   - [ ] GameObject{ }
   - [ ] GameObject
   - [ ] GameObject( )
   - [x] **GameObject[ ]**
     > When writing an array in your code, you must use square brackets. The square brackets tell your code that you’ve created an array.

4. The numbers used to reference objects or elements in an array are called range.

   - [ ] True
   - [x] **False**
     > The numbers within the square brackets of an array are called an index.

5. If you have a variable that will be shared by several functions in your code, you should add it outside of any method.

   - [x] **True**
   - [ ] False
     > If you have a variable that you’re going to use throughout your code, you should put it outside of any method.

6. A Vector3 variable is helpful to store an object’s position.

   - [ ] True
   - [x] **False**
     > A Vector3 variable stores a position in three-dimensional space or an object’s position.

7. Instead of using numbers, what can you use to make your code more readable?

   - [x] **Variables**
     > Variables can make your code more readable and easier to update if you need to change any values during development.

8. Which method can be used for repeating a chosen method at a consistent rate?

   - [ ] InvokePerpetual()
   - [x] **InvokeRepeating()**
   - [ ] Use RepeatOverRate
   - [ ] Call the repeat function
     > The InvokeRepeating() method calls on a different method and constantly repeats it over a rate of time.

9. A The trigger checkbox should be selected in a Box Collider to detect when another object collides with the Box Collider.

   - [x] **True**
   - [ ] False
     > When you select the trigger checkbox in the inspector, this tells your game when another object collides with the Box Collider.

10. Colliders require an array to detect a Collision in your physics.

    - [ ] True
    - [x] **False**
      > Colliders require a Rigidbody to be able to detect a Collision in your physics and help objects act the way they should in real life.
