1. Which of the following makes it possible for your app to detect an image in the real world and trigger some action, such as displaying AR content, when the image is detected? Select the best answer.

   - [ ] AR Foundation
   - [ ] 3D model
   - [ ] Plane manager
   - [x] **Marker-based AR**
     > An AR marker is an image that your app will search for in the real world. When the app detects the marker, it will project a 3D model on top of the marker in AR. The marker works somewhat like a QR code, except that instead of taking you to a website, it can trigger an entire AR experience.

2. Which Unity feature brings the power of Unity scripting to non-coders and future coders? Select the best answer.

   - [x] **Visual Scripting**
   - [ ] Components
   - [ ] Unity Hub
   - [ ] C# compatibility
     > For the visually-oriented, Visual Scripting makes it easier to learn and understand scripting concepts, and even watch your scripts run in real time!

3. Which of the following statements about Unity Visual Scripting are true? Select all that apply.

   - [x] **Coders can also use Visual Scripting to create extensions, templates and tools for other Unity users.**
     > Visual Scripting is a great way to support other Unity users and give back to the community!
   - [x] **Visual Scripting uses node-based graphs.**
     > Visual scripting uses visual, node-based graphs, which both programmers and non-programmers use to design final logic or create prototypes.
   - [x] **In Visual Scripting, you can look up any class, event, method and property in the API through a series of menus, making it easier to find and discover what you need.**
     > Visual scripting has an API that programmers can use for more advanced tasks.
   - [ ] Visual Scripting requires knowledge of C# scripting.

4. True or false: The reasons that companies use marker-based AR vary, but often it is used to provide additional content about something in the real world. Select the best answer.

   - [x] **True**
   - [ ] False
     > From fun games that make pizza boxes interactive, business cards that come to life, art that comes off the canvas, or tattoo planning apps that let you place and edit what you want tattoos to look like, marker-based AR has a lot of use cases!

5. Which of the following are strategies for achieving the right scale for your object in Unity? Select all that apply.

   - [x] **Use the objectâ€™s true scale.**
     > This is particularly important for real-life use cases such as training or shopping applications.
   - [ ] Set the Transform Position to X=0, Y=0 and Z=1.
   - [x] **Temporarily add a cube to the scene to create a kind of primitive measuring stick.**
     > Remember that one Unity unit is equal to one meter in the real world. So if you want your chosen GameObject to be 0.5 meters tall, it should be the same height as a cube scaled down to 0.5.
   - [x] **Transform the X, Y and Z axis values.**
     > You can adjust the X, Y and Z axis values of your object until you achieve the desired result.
