1. AR is any kind of digital layer that is placed over the physical world in a way that allows you to still be present in it.

   - [x] **True**
   - [ ] False
     > A face filter is an example of AR: a digital layer is placed over the physical world — in this case, over a face — in a way that allows you to still be present in it.

2. AR stands for artificial reality.

   - [ ] True
   - [x] **False**
     > AR stands for augmented reality. It is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital layers.

3. What is it called when the physical and digital worlds are combined?

   - [x] **Extended reality**
   - [ ] Alternate reality
   - [ ] Exterior range
   - [ ] Fractal reality
     > Extended reality, or XR, is the catch-all term for how we combine the physical and digital worlds. The digital world includes AR, MR and VR.

4. Why is the XR spectrum line “blurring” between AR, MR and VR?

   - [x] **Advancements in technologies and applications**
   - [ ] Advancements in coding languages
   - [ ] Advancements in game play
   - [ ] All of the above.
     > With more and more advances in technologies and applications, the line between AR, MR and VR is becoming blurred. For example, a VR headset may allow AR to happen, creating more of an XR ecosystem (versus an XR spectrum).

5. Where does AR fall on the XR spectrum?

   - [ ] It’s not on the XR spectrum.
   - [x] **It’s the baseline on the XR spectrum as far as digital immersion.**
   - [ ] It’s at the top end of the XR spectrum as far as digital immersion.
   - [ ] It’s in the middle of the XR spectrum as far as digital immersion.
     > AR is the most accessible but least immersive and sits on the baseline of the XR spectrum.

6. Special equipment is needed to consume AR technology.

   - [ ] True
   - [x] **False**
     > AR is the most approachable and accessible technology on the XR spectrum and doesn’t require special equipment to access it.

7. How might companies benefit from using AR for marketing purposes?

   - [ ] They can use AR to increase their stock values.
   - [x] **They can use AR to help increase user engagement, attention and satisfaction.**
   - [ ] They can use AR to decrease employee turnover.
   - [ ] AR is not used in business.
     > For marketing purposes, companies have figured out that AR can help increase user engagement, attention and satisfaction. For example, a clothing manufacturer might use AR to help you see how an outfit looks on you before you buy it.

8. Extensive programming experience is required when developing AR.

   - [ ] True
   - [x] **False**
     > Hard-core programming and development experience isn’t required. For example, people who come from an influencer background can learn the basics of AR and use their creativity and production skills to implement ideas. And, while creativity is important, it’s not a necessity. AR truly opens doors to all levels of developers and affords the opportunity to be part of the front wave of development and defining of the future.

9. In the future, will AR likely influence how devices are made?

   - [x] **Yes**
   - [ ] No
     > AR development will help drive how devices are made. Camera and processor improvements on mobile devices will likely advance as the demand for technologies that can support AR applications will no doubt increase. Better cameras, support for increased depth, 5G bandwidth capabilities and additional storage will be needed to render AR applications.

10. One area of AR development that hasn’t changed is the production surface.
    - [ ] True
    - [x] **False**
      > The AR production surface has evolved and gone from command-line style to using robust tools like Meta Spark, which uses full visual programming and is both user friendly and accessible.
