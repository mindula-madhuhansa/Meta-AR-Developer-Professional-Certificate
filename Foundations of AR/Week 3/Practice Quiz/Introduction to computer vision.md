1. What does computer vision do?

   - [ ] Computer vision enables computers to “think.”
   - [x] **Computer vision trains computers to interpret, understand and react to what they’re seeing.**
   - [ ] Computer vision allows for computers to put a filter on the device screen for a better viewing experience.
   - [ ] Computer vision provides equipment for end-users for a completely immersive experience.
     > Computer vision allows systems to derive meaningful information from the world around you and from other digital inputs such as videos or images.

2. Which of the following are categories of computer vision used for AR effects?

   - [x] **World tracking**
     > World tracking is a category of computer vision with AR effects. In world tracking, the AR system provides a real-time estimate of how the device is rotating and translating in 3D relative to the environment.
   - [x] **2D tracking**
     > 2D tracking is a category of computer vision with AR effects. In this category, the computer identifies positions and pixels of the same object over and over again and creates unique identifiers and then tracks the objects as they move around a frame.
   - [x] **Object detection**
     > Object detection is a category of computer vision with AR effects. It allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video.
   - [ ] Algorithms

3. Which of the following are best practices for computer vision in AR?

   - [x] **Test**
     > Test the AR effects based on how they will be used. Use trial and error, especially with 3D effects, and consider what those effects will look like on the device.
   - [x] **Consider the file size of the algorithm.**
     > Algorithms can be very large in size. With multiple algorithms for different tasks, the final deliverable package to power an AR experience can be impactful. Consumers may have limited bandwidth to download content onto their phones, and those phones typically have more limited storage than a desktop.
   - [x] **Use good data.**
     > The computer vision model will only be as good as the data fed into it. Create extremely detailed images that are so distinct, the computer cannot mistake different elements in the image.
   - [ ] Develop for the newest devices.

4. Which category of computer vision that is used for AR effects labels specific regions of an image according to what’s being shown?

   - [ ] Object detection
   - [x] **Segmentation**
   - [ ] 3D tracking
   - [ ] World tracking
     > Segmentation is a category of computer vision in which specific regions of an image are labeled according to what's being shown. Every pixel of an image is assigned a label. Instance segmentation identifies some pixels containing one object, while other pixels contain another object, thus allowing definition of two separate objects.

5. Which computer vision element supports AR for locating real-world elements?

   - [ ] Object detection
   - [x] **SLAM**
   - [ ] SLM
   - [ ] 3D tracking
     > Simultaneous localization and mapping, or SLAM, is a form of computer vision that supports AR for locating real-world elements. It helps track the camera's position and its location, and also estimates an image sensor position.
